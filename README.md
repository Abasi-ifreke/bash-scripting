# bash-scripting
writing a bash script to automate account set up



## How it works
The user starts the process by running `bash script.sh`
Before running the script, you wil have to provide three variables
1. add/remove
2. username
3. email address

using add/remove tells the bash script to either add or remove a user
The username provided will be what the script will use to set up an account and also add it to the home directory.
The email address provided will be used to send the login details to the owner of the account.
